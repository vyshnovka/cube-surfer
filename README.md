# Cube Surfer

This is a simplified clone of the Cube Surfer game on Unity.

The idea was to recreate cube stacking mechanics from the original game.    
The path spline was created using the *Dreamteck Splines* plugin from Unity Asset Store.

Do not expect any path randomizations.    
This is just an example of mechanics.
